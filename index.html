        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webapge</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage</li>
          <li>It is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development</li>
          <li> It is used to great the structure of a webpage</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements: text, image, header, list</li>
          <li>HTML attribute defines additional information about an element</li>

          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport
          <li>The body element is a semantic HTML element, it describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
          <li> It is important to use semantic HTML elements because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and users</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, it is contained between and opening tag and closing tag</li>
          <li>Closing tags begin with a forward slash /</li>

          <li>href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector, then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enbaling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        
        <ul>

          <li>Enter your CSS notes here</li>
          <li>It is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal</li>
          <li>Each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change</li>
          <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements</li>
          <li>The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
          <li>Most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>It is the most preferred because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations will apply, ex: div</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. Ex color:blue the CSS property is color and the value for it is blue</li>
          <li>Margin property acts like a margin in a word processing document, it indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. if it set to 0 we are indicating that we want no extra space around the element</li>
          <li>Padding property adds space around the content inside an element, when you increase padding you are making the entire element bigger</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all the elements visible on a page, we use * and this will declare that all the elements on the page will have the style properties margin and padding set as 0</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. Dry can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase</li>
          <li>text-align is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage</li>
          <li>the img selector assigns property values to any image element</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow affects around an element's frame</li>
          <li> You can assign colors in CSS in many ways, including by its semantic references such as gray or blue or also by its hex #</li>
